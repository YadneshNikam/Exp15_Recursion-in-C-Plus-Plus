# Exp15_Recursion-in-C-Plus-Plus
### Aim  
To study and implement the concept of recursion in C++.  

### Software Required  
Visual Studio (or any C++ IDE).  

### Theory  
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until a terminating condition, known as the base case, is satisfied. Such a function is called a *recursive function*.  

Every recursive function consists of two essential parts:  
- **Recursive Case**: Defines how the problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems.  
- **Base Case**: Defines the stopping condition of recursion to prevent infinite calls.  

### Applications of Recursion  
Recursion has wide applications in computer science, including:  
- **Problem Solving**: Factorial calculation, Fibonacci series generation, array reversal, Tower of Hanoi.  
- **Backtracking**: Used in N-Queens, Sudoku solving, and maze problems where trial and error with undo operations is required.  
- **Searching and Sorting**: Algorithms like binary search, quicksort, and merge sort use recursion to divide problems into smaller tasks.  
- **Tree and Graph Traversal**: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are naturally expressed with recursive methods.  
- **Mathematical Computations**: Factorials, GCD, Fibonacci numbers, and power calculations.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Recursion is used to break problems into overlapping sub-problems before applying optimizations.  

### Implementation  
The concept of recursion was studied and implemented through the following C++ programs:  
- Factorial using recursion  
- Sum of integers using recursion  
- String reversal using recursion  
- Integer reversal using recursion  

### Conclusion  
Through the implementation of different programs, the concept of recursion in C++ was successfully understood and demonstrated.
